# Building APIs for Practice

In an attempt to practice building APIs, this repo was born. 

Client side code (`index.html` && `/public/main.js`) included in this repo consumes the server side code || API (`server.js`) hosted on Heroku.

The interface to this api is:

```sh
https://rapsupreme-api.herokuapp.com/:param
```

where `param` is the key used to access any of the values in:

```
{
  "21 savage": { age: 29, birthName: "Charles Hayden Savage", birthLocation: "London, England" },
  "falz": { age: 31, birthName: "Folarin Falana", birthLocation: "Ibadan, Oyo" },
  "taz": { age: 18, birthName: "Taz", birthLocation: "Taz, Taz" },
}
```

Have fun!
